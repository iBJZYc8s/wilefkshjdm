Jack® & Coke® lovers, we’ve officially entered whiskey wonderland. We took the classic two-ingredient cocktail and layered in a variety of festive flavors. If you like your holiday spirit with a hint of sweetness, we’ve got a drink for you. If spice (or spicy) is more your vibe, we’ve got those two, too. Three cheers to that!
